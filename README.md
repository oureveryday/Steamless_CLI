# Steamless

Steamless is a DRM remover of the various SteamStub variants applied to applications and games released on Steam via the DRM tool in the Steamworks SDK.

Steamless aims to be a single solution for unpacking all variants of the SteamStub DRM, ranging from the very first version to the most recently released.

_However, due to personal limited funds, I cannot test every game myself._

Modded to use steamless with command line by "Steamless.CLI.exe".

Usage: Steamless.CLI.exe <EXEFILE>

# What Steamless Will Do

Steamless will remove the SteamStub DRM protection layer that is applied via the DRM tool from the Steamworks SDK.

# What Steamless Wont Do

Steamless **WILL NEVER** do any of the following:

  * Steamless will never remove the Steamworks API integration. (via steam_api.dll/steam_api64.dll)
  * Steamless will never include or distribute any emulator for the Steamworks API integration.
  * Steamless will never handle Valve's CEG (Custom Executable Generation) DRM that is used on some older games.
  * Steamless will never promote, encourage, or assist with piracy.
  * Steamless will never assist with bypassing anti-cheats or other protections in place by games.

Do not ask for help with running games without Steam. Your requests will be ignored/blocked.

That is not the scope or goal of this project.

# What is SteamStub DRM?

From the Steamworks documentation:

> Steamworks Digital Rights Management wraps your game's compiled executable and checks to make sure that it is running under an authenticated instance of Steam. This DRM solution is the same as the one used to protect games like Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source. Steamworks DRM has been heavily road-tested and is customer-friendly.
> In addition to DRM solutions, Steamworks also offers protection for game through day one release by shipping encrypted media to stores worldwide. There's no worry that your game will leak early from the manufacturing path, because your game stays encrypted until the moment you decide to release it. This protection can be added to your game simply by handing us finished bits or a gold master. <br><br>
